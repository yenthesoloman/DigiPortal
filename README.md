# DigiPortal English Learning Website

This is a simple prototype for an English learning website with the following goals:

1. Natural sounding voice using the browser's built-in **Web Speech API**.
2. Everyday life examples to practice from.
3. Ability to simulate different scenarios based on user input.
4. A basic UI to interact with the application.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Choose a scenario and click "Start Conversation". The site will speak a phrase and listen to your response via the microphone, carrying on a short dialog.

This prototype works entirely in the browser and does not require a server. The scenario generation is based on predefined examples, but you can expand `script.js` to fetch dynamic content from your own service.
